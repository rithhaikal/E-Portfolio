# LAB

## PC Assemble

In this lab, we are required to disassemble and assemble a PC.

##  *Reflection*

During the PC assembly lab, I learned a lot of components inside a computer and their functions and how to physically assemble the components of a computer system. The assistant helped us from disassembling the computer and assemble it back until it works properly. Overall it is a valuable experience for all of us.
