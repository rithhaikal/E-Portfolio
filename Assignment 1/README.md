# INDUSTRY TALK 1:

## OVERVIEW OF ICT JOBS IN CLARITY TECHWORKS SDN BHD

As part of this project, we have to create a poster regarding the industry speak that Universiti Teknologi Malaysia and Clarity Techworks Sdn Bhd are collaborating on using Webex.

## REFLECTION

The industrial discussion began with an overview of the company's primary product, Rapidz Pay, and included insightful information about the discipline of computer science. With an emphasis on critical skills for the industry, each speaker described their positions and the software they utilised. The conversation emphasised the differences between professional and academic life and the need of having a solid foundation and ongoing curiosity. My perspective on work in this sector has changed as a result of this experience, which has highlighted the value of self-exploration outside of the classroom. I became aware of the wealth of internet tools available, such as Udemy, for keeping up of business trends. I was inspired by this discussion to study harder, aim for certifications, and aggressively seek out new insights from the Faculty of Computing.
