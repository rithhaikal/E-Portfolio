# DESIGN THINKING

## Report on Design Thinking
In this project, we are required to identify related problems with our chapter and design a prototype to solve the problems.

##  *Reflection*
My goal regarding my Technology Information System course is to become an expert in using technology
to solve challenging problems in the industry. My approach has been greatly influenced by the design
thinking method, which is demonstrated through the development of a hostel management application
called “Hostel Hero”. Through prioritising user needs, implementing feedback-driven iterations and
encouraging teamwork, we have not only created a workable application but also cultivated a mindset
aligned with the design thinking ideas. To further improve my potential in the industry, I intend to keep up
with the trend of technology developments, broaden my technical skill set, actively participate in the tech
community for networking and look into internship opportunities for hands-on, real-world experience.
